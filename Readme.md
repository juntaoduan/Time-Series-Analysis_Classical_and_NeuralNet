## General info

The project is meant to compare classical Time Series models, such as ARIMA method with the recently emerged transformer model.

Major steps involved in classical time series analysis were as follow :                                 
* STEP: 1 - Data Cleaning and Analysis
* STEP: 2 - Checking Stationarity (ADF Test) 
* STEP: 3 - Transformation, Differencing  
* STEP: 4 - Finding ACF and PACF
* STEP: 5 - ARIMA, SARIMAX modeling and testing

Major steps involved in transformer: 
* STEP: 1 - Create cusomized transformer architecture for time series
* STEP: 2 - Design data class and create data in batch
* STEP: 3 - Build transformer 
* STEP: 4 - Train and fine-tune parameters on the data
* STEP: 5 - Testing and saving model

** Compare the methods on single variable and multiple variables time series data
